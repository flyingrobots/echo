# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Added `crates/echo-dind-harness` to the Echo workspace (moved from flyingrobots.dev).
- Added determinism guard scripts: `scripts/ban-globals.sh`, `scripts/ban-nondeterminism.sh`, and `scripts/ban-unordered-abi.sh`.
- Added `ECHO_ROADMAP.md` to capture phased plans aligned with recent ADRs.
- Removed legacy wasm encode helpers from `warp-wasm` (TS encoders are the protocol source of truth).
