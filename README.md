> _Echo is a recursive metagraph (RMG) simulation engine that executes and rewrites typed graphs deterministically across branching timelines and merges them through confluence._

### Say what??

**Echo is an ambitious, mind-bending, fundamentally different computational model for game engines and other interactive simulations.** The RMG is a powerful mathematical tool that brings the full weight of textbook category theory to interactive computational experiences. 

Most game engines are object-oriented state machines. Unity, Unreal, Godot all maintain mutable object hierarchies that update every frame. Echo says: "No, everything is a graph, and the engine rewrites that graph deterministically using typed transformation rules." 

Echo is fundamentally **built different**.

Echo is a computer program that runs a recursive metagraph (RMG), a **typed, deterministic graph-rewriting engine**.

RMG provides atomic, in-place edits of recursive meta-graphs with deterministic local scheduling and snapshot isolation.

It’s the core of the Echo engine: runtime, assets, networking, and tools all operate on the same living graph of graphs.

## **tl;dr:**

> ECHO is a game engine that treats _everything_—code, data, and time itself—as one big living graph.
> It’s built so every change can branch, merge, and replay perfectly.

### The short pitch

ECHO runs on something called an **RMG (Recursive Meta-Graph)**. Think of it as a graph-based operating system. Everything in the engine (worlds, entities, physics, shaders, even the tools) lives inside that graph.

Echo doesn’t “update objects.” It _rewrites_ parts of the graph using a set of deterministic rules. That’s what “graph rewriting” means.

### Why this is cool

- **Deterministic:** same inputs = same world every time.
- **Branching:** you can fork reality, change it, and merge it back without chaos.
- **Confluent:** independent edits always end up in the same final state.
- **Snapshot-based:** you can freeze the whole graph at any moment for replay or rollback.
- **Recursive:** a node can contain its own sub-graph—systems inside systems.

### In Plain English

Echo feels like if Minecraft, Git, and a physics engine had a baby that understood time travel.
You can pause time, fork a copy of reality, try out a new idea, and merge the timelines back together, without breaking determinism.

## Advantages

> *"Things are only impossible until they're not."* — Jean-Luc Picard

Can your game engine do...

### Perfect Determinism 

Same input graph + same rules = same output, always. This is huge for:

- Networked multiplayer (no desync, ever)
- Replays (just store the initial state + inputs)
- Testing (reproducible bugs)
- Time travel debugging

### Branching Timelines 

> “All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.” — _Gandalf, The Lord of the Rings_

The Git metaphor is accurate. Fork reality, try something, merge back. This enables:

- Speculative execution
- "What if?" simulation
- Save/load that's mathematically guaranteed to work

### Confluence

Independent changes converge to the same result. This is operational transformation meets game engine, and it's bonkers powerful for:

- Collaborative editing
- Distributed simulation
- Conflict-free merges

### Everything-is-a-graph 

Rules are graphs. Systems are graphs. The whole runtime is a graph. This gives you:

- Introspection at every level
- Hot-reloading without special cases
- Tools that operate on the same substrate as the engine
- Zero-copy loading

---

## The Math Checks Out

The mathematical properties of RMGs offer:

- **Folds (catamorphisms)**: there is a guaranteed, one-true way to “walk” the graph.
  - That’s how rendering, physics, and serialization all stay consistent: they’re just different folds over the same data.
- **Double-Pushout (DPO) rewriting**: a safe, proven way to modify graphs.
  - Instead of ad-hoc mutation, every change is a rewrite rule with an explicit match and replacement, so the engine can reason about merges, rollbacks, and conflicts.
- **Confluence** – when two people or two threads make compatible edits, they deterministically converge to the same state.
  - That’s the key to multiplayer sync, time-travel debugging, and collaborative editing.

There's a ton of other advanced reasons why it's cool, but that's nerd stuff. Let's just say that the RMG is weird, and **extremely powerful.**

- Start each task by verifying a clean git state and branching (`echo/<feature>` recommended).
- Tests go in `packages/echo-core/test/` (fixtures in `test/fixtures/`). End-to-end scenarios will eventually live under `apps/playground`.
- Use expressive commits (`subject` / `body` / optional `trailer`)—tell future us the *why*, not just the *what*.
- Treat determinism as sacred: prefer Echo’s PRNG, avoid non-deterministic APIs without wrapping them.
  
### Development Principles

1. **Tests First** – Write failing unit/integration/branch tests before new engine work.
2. **Branch Discipline** – Feature branches target `main`; keep `main` pristine.
3. **Document Ruthlessly** – Update specs/diagrams and log decisions.
4. **Temporal Mindset** – Think *Chronos* (sequence), *Kairos* (possibility), *Aion* (significance) whenever touching runtime code.

### Roadmap Highlights

- [x] **Phase 0** – Finalize specs and design.
- [ ] **Phase 1** – Ship Echo Core MVP with tests and headless harness.
- [ ] **Phase 2 “Double-Jump”** – Deliver reference render/input adapters and the playground.
- [ ] **Phase 3+** – Physics, WebGPU, audio, inspector, and full temporal tooling.

Chrononauts welcome. Strap in, branch responsibly, and leave the timeline cleaner than you found it.
