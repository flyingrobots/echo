# warp-cli

Placeholder CLI for Echo tooling. Subcommands will be added as the engine matures.

See the repository root `README.md` for project context.

## What this crate does

- Provides a home for command-line entrypoints into Echo tooling:
  - future subcommands for running the engine, inspecting WARPs, driving the
    session service, etc.
- Currently a placeholder; behavior will be fleshed out alongside engine and
  tooling milestones.

## Documentation

- For now, see the root `README.md` and the Echo book (`docs/book/echo/`) for
  the overall architecture and planned CLI roles (runtime control, debugging,
  inspection).
