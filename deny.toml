# Modernized for cargo-deny >=0.14.21 (PR #611):
# - Removed deprecated keys `copyleft` and `unlicensed`.
#   Copyleft licenses remain effectively denied by virtue of the explicit
#   `allow = [...]` list above.
#   Crates missing a license will be flagged by cargo-deny as issues; our
#   workspace crates all declare licenses, so no explicit `unlicensed` policy
#   is required here.
