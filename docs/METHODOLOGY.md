# JITOS Engineering Standard: The Living Specification

**Status:** In Progress (living spec scaffold exists; certification pending)  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Context:** Development Methodology & Contributor Workflow

## 1. Abstract

The JITOS operating system rejects the traditional dichotomy between "code" and "documentation." Given the paradigm-shifting nature of the Causal Operating System (Recursive Metagraphs, Event Sourcing, Schrödinger Workspaces), static text is insufficient to convey system behavior.

Instead, JITOS adopts the **"5x Duty" Methodology**. Every feature added to the kernel must simultaneously serve five distinct purposes through a single, unified codebase. We do not write documentation *about* the OS; we compile the OS *into* the documentation.

## 1.1 Current Status in This Repository (Echo)

This document describes the **target** JITOS workflow, but not every element is implemented yet in this repo.

As of **2025-12-28**:

- Implemented:
  - A living-spec scaffold exists for **Spec-000** at `specs/spec-000-rewrite/` (Leptos + Trunk).
  - WASM-friendly DTOs live in `crates/echo-wasm-abi/` and the current “demo kernel” wrapper lives in `crates/echo-wasm-bindings/`.
- Not implemented yet (aspirational):
  - A `no_std` kernel crate named `crates/echo-kernel`.
  - Hosted spec domains like `spec-001.jitos.dev`.
  - Automatic UI-issued “Completion Hash” contributor certification.

## 2. The 5x Duty Model

Every Major Feature Specification (SPEC) acts as a unified artifact fulfilling these five roles:

1. **Documentation:** A narrative explanation of the feature (the "Why" and "What").
2. **Implementation:** The actual, production-grade Rust code (the "How").
3. **Interactive Demo:** A WebAssembly-compiled instance of the kernel running in the browser, allowing real-time state manipulation.
4. **Living Test:** A visual verification suite where the "Demo" acts as a graphical test runner.
5. **Certification:** A gamified proof-of-competence that issues a cryptographic hash to users who successfully drive the kernel to a target state, proving they understand the concept.

## 3. Workflow Architecture

The following diagram illustrates how a single Rust source feed generates the Kernel, the Spec, and the Verification assets simultaneously.

## 4. The Contributor Lifecycle

Under this methodology, the "Onboarding" process is identical to the "Testing" process.

1. **The Challenge:** A new contributor runs the current living spec locally (e.g. `make spec-000-dev`).
2. **The Context:** They read the narrative explaining *why* JITOS uses append-only storage.
3. **The Interaction:** They use the embedded WASM demo to attempt a rewrite. This executes the current demo kernel logic compiled to WASM.
4. **The Validation:** If they correctly perform the operation (e.g., creating a transaction rather than mutating a value), the Kernel state updates successfully.
5. **The Certification (planned):** A future UI win-condition will generate a `Completion Hash` for contributor certification.
6. **The Contribution (today):** The contributor includes the relevant test evidence (and/or spec screenshots/logs) in their PR, and reviewers validate the spec + tests.

## 5. Technical Stack

To enable this workflow, we strictly separate **Logic** from **IO**.

- **Logic (Kernel slices):** Written in Rust crates under `crates/`. The long-term goal is to isolate a `no_std` kernel core, but the current Spec-000 demo kernel is not `no_std` yet.
- **The Spec Runner (WASM):** Uses **Leptos** and **Trunk** to bind the Kernel Logic to DOM elements.
- **The OS Runner (Native):** Binds the Kernel Logic to physical hardware drivers and NVMe storage.

## 6. Definition of Done

A feature is not "Done" until:

- [ ] Formatting is clean: `cargo fmt` (or via the repo hooks).
- [ ] The code builds and tests pass: `cargo test`.
- [ ] Public APIs are documented and the docs gate is clean: `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D missing_docs`.
- [ ] SPDX header policy is satisfied: `scripts/check_spdx.sh --check --all`.
- [ ] Docs Guard is satisfied: update `docs/execution-plan.md` and `docs/decision-log.md` when non-doc code changes.
- [ ] If the change is spec-facing: a `specs/spec-XXX` directory exists and the spec page explains the concept.
- [ ] If the change is spec-facing: the spec imports the relevant kernel slice and provides an interactive demo harness.
- [ ] If/when certification is enabled: the spec defines a deterministic “win condition” that can emit a completion proof (planned; not yet implemented).
