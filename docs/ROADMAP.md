# Echo Roadmap (Milestones + Issue Map)

This roadmap reconciles our current plan with GitHub milestones, issues, and the Project board (Project 9). It is the single source of truth for “what’s next”.

---

## Milestones

- M1 – Golden Tests
  - Bit‑exact golden vectors for state_root/commit_id (genesis, merge, empty)
  - Math kernel goldens (rotation/multiply/sin/cos)
  - CI matrix: macOS + Ubuntu (glibc) + Alpine (musl)
- M2.0 – Scalar Foundation
  - Scalar trait; F32Scalar deterministic wrappers; DFix64 Q32.32
  - Deterministic transcendentals (LUT + refinement); tables checked‑in
  - Motion rule → Scalar; v2 payload (6×i64 Q32.32), dual decode v1/v2
- M2.1 – Lattice Joins
  - Lattice trait; scheduler fold order
  - Exemplar lattices: tags union, cap/max
  - ACI property + replay determinism tests
- M2.2 – Playground Slice
  - Minimal WASM demo; CLI run/diff showing replay‑identical hashes
- M2.5 – Accumulator Joins
  - Delta‑style joins; deterministic rounding/saturation; ACI + replay
- M3 – Sweep‑and‑Prune v1
  - Integerized endpoints; stable tie‑breakers; ordering/stability property tests
- M4 – Determinism Proof & Publish 0.1
  - Prove determinism across OSes; finalize docs; publish rmg‑core/geom 0.1

## Issue Table (live snapshot)

Rows are GitHub issues. Priority/Estimate reflect Project 9 fields. Block/parent relationships use native GitHub issue dependencies; no custom text fields are used.

| Issue Name | # | Milestone | Priority | Estimate | Blocked By | Blocking | Parent | Children | Remarks |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Benchmarks & CI Regression Gates | 22 | M1 – Golden Tests | P1 | 13h+ |  | #42,#43,#44,#45,#46 |  | 42,43,44,45,46 | Umbrella for perf pipeline |

| CLI: verify/bench/inspect | 23 | M2.2 – Playground Slice | P2 | 5h |  |  |  |  | Grouping placeholder; break down in PRs |
| Scaffold CLI subcommands | 47 | M2.2 – Playground Slice | P2 | 5h |  |  |  |  |  |
| Implement 'verify' | 48 | M2.2 – Playground Slice | P2 | 5h |  |  |  |  |  |
| Implement 'bench' | 49 | M2.2 – Playground Slice | P2 | 5h |  |  |  |  |  |

| Docs/man pages | 51 | M2.2 – Playground Slice | P2 | 5h |  |  |  |  | Tie docs to CLI UX |
| README+docs (defaults & toggles) | 41 | M4 – Determinism Proof & Publish 0.1 | P2 | 3h |  |  |  |  | Docs polish before 0.1 |
| Spec: Commit/Manifest Signing | 20 | Backlog |  |  |  |  |  |  | Keep under Backlog until publish plan is firm |
| Spec: Security Contexts (FFI/WASM/CLI) | 21 | Backlog |  |  |  |  |  |  | Backlog (security track) |
| Plugin ABI (C) v0 | 26 | Backlog |  |  |  |  |  |  | Track in separate ABI milestone later |
| Example plugin + tests | 89 | Backlog |  |  |  |  |  |  | Depends on ABI |
| Capability tokens | 88 | Backlog |  |  |  |  |  |  | — |
| Version negotiation | 87 | Backlog |  |  |  |  |  |  | — |
| C header + host loader | 86 | Backlog |  |  |  |  |  |  | — |
| Draft C ABI spec | 85 | Backlog |  |  |  |  |  |  | — |
| Importer + store tasks | 80–84 | Backlog |  |  |  |  |  |  | Import flow (spec/loader/reader) |

Note: Backlog means “not part of the current M1/M2 trajectory”; issues remain visible in the Project with the `backlog` label and can be re‑prioritized later.

## Immediate Plan (Next PRs)

- PR‑11 (Closes #42): benches crate skeleton (Criterion + harness)
- PR‑12 (Closes #43): snapshot hash microbench
- PR‑13 (Closes #44): scheduler drain microbench
- PR‑14 (Closes #45): JSON artifact + upload
- PR‑15 (Closes #46): regression thresholds gate

In parallel (when ready): seed M2.0 – Scalar Foundation umbrella and child issues, then start the first scalar PR (trait + backends skeleton).

Maintainers: keep this file in sync when re‑prioritizing or moving issues between milestones. This roadmap complements the Project board, which carries Priority/Estimate fields and live status.
