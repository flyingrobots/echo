# F10.5: Importer

Umbrella for the TurtlGraph-to-Echo-store importer. All child tasks (#80-84) are closed. This feature needs an audit to determine if the umbrella issue can be closed.

**Issue:** #25

## T-10-5-1: Importer Umbrella Audit + Close (#25)

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want to audit the importer umbrella issue so that it can be closed if all work is complete, or remaining gaps are identified.

**Requirements:**

- R1: Verify all child issues (#80, #81, #82, #83, #84) are merged and tested
- R2: Run the importer end-to-end on a representative TurtlGraph dataset
- R3: Confirm no regressions in CI
- R4: Close #25 if audit passes, or file follow-up issues if gaps are found

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] AC1: Audit checklist completed for all five child issues
- [ ] AC2: End-to-end import test passes on a representative dataset
- [ ] AC3: #25 is either closed with a summary comment, or follow-up issues are filed
- [ ] AC4: No dead code or orphaned modules left from the importer work

**Definition of Done:**

- [ ] Code reviewed and merged
- [ ] Tests pass (CI green)
- [ ] Documentation updated (if applicable)

**Scope:** Audit, end-to-end verification, issue hygiene.
**Out of Scope:** New importer features, performance optimization.

**Test Plan:**

- **Goldens:** End-to-end import output for a known TurtlGraph fixture
- **Failures:** n/a (audit task)
- **Edges:** Empty graph, graph with cycles
- **Fuzz/Stress:** n/a

**Blocked By:** none
**Blocking:** none

**Est. Hours:** 2h
**Expected Complexity:** ~0 LoC (audit only)
