# Demo: Tumble Tower

Priority: P2  
Status: Planned  
Blocked By: First Light

Objective: deliver the physics-focused teaching game demo with a deterministic "physics ladder".

## Features

- [F8.2 Tumble Tower](./F8.2-tumble-tower.md) (Repo: Echo)

## Exit Criteria

- Stage 0-3 physics progression is deterministic with golden fingerprints.
- Two-peer lockstep harness verifies deterministic behavior.
- Visualization and course modules are complete and validated.

Note: current task set is an initial skeleton and expected to grow significantly during game design and implementation.
