# Determinism Foundations

Priority: P0  
Status: In Progress  
Blocked By: none

Objective: complete domain-separated hashing and benchmark umbrella close-out to lock deterministic hash foundations.

## Features

- [F1.1 Domain-Separated Hash Contexts](./F1.1-domain-separated-hash-contexts.md) (Repo: Echo)
- [F1.2 Benchmarks Pipeline Cleanup](./F1.2-benchmarks-pipeline-cleanup.md) (Repo: Echo)

## Exit Criteria

- Canonical hash vectors are committed and verified in CI.
- Cross-domain collision tests exist and pass.
- Benchmarks umbrella audit is completed and issue closure is documented.
