Final documentation pass before 0.1 publish. README, configuration defaults, feature toggles, and getting-started guide.

## T-9-4-1: Docs polish — README + defaults + toggles (#41)

**User Story:** As a new user evaluating Echo 0.1, I want a clear README with getting-started instructions, documented configuration defaults, and a feature toggle reference so that I can start using the engine without reading every spec document.

**Requirements:**

- R1: Rewrite the root `README.md` for the 0.1 audience: project description, quickstart (clone, build, run golden tests), architecture overview diagram, link to docs.
- R2: Document all configuration defaults in a "Configuration Reference" section: scalar backend (default: F32Scalar), thread count, checkpoint interval, admission budgets.
- R3: Document all Cargo feature flags: `det_fixed`, any debug/profiling features, WASM target features.
- R4: Add a "Getting Started" guide page in `docs/guide/` that walks through building, running the CLI, and verifying determinism.
- R5: Review and update all cross-references in existing spec docs to ensure they point to correct file paths.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] AC1: README includes project description, quickstart (3 commands), and architecture diagram.
- [ ] AC2: Configuration reference lists at least 6 configurable parameters with defaults.
- [ ] AC3: Feature flag reference lists all Cargo features with descriptions.
- [ ] AC4: Getting Started guide is a single page that a new user can follow in under 15 minutes.
- [ ] AC5: No broken cross-references in `docs/` (verified by link checker or manual audit).

**Definition of Done:**

- [ ] Code reviewed and merged
- [ ] Tests pass (CI green)
- [ ] Documentation updated (if applicable)

**Scope:** README rewrite, configuration reference, feature flags, getting-started guide, cross-reference audit.
**Out of Scope:** API reference documentation (generated from rustdoc); tutorial content (covered by MS-8 demos); marketing/landing page.

**Test Plan:**

- **Goldens:** n/a (docs)
- **Failures:** n/a
- **Edges:** n/a
- **Fuzz/Stress:** n/a

**Blocked By:** T-9-3-1
**Blocking:** none

**Est. Hours:** 4h
**Expected Complexity:** ~600 LoC (markdown)
