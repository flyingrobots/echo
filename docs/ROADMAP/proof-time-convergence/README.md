# Proof+Time Convergence

Priority: P2  
Status: Planned  
Blocked By: Proof Core, Time Travel

Objective: prove replay/worldline convergence in the presence of timeline semantics.

## Features

- [F9.2 Worldline Convergence Suite](./F9.2-worldline-convergence-suite.md) (Repo: Echo)

## Exit Criteria

- Replay from checkpoints and patches converges to canonical worldlines.
- Branched worldline replay and convergence tests are green across target platforms.
