# Splash Guy

> **Priority:** P2 | **Status:** Planned | **Est:** TBD (current skeleton ~28h)

A grid-based water balloon game demonstrating deterministic rules, lockstep networking, and intentional desync lessons. Two peers exchange inputs, per-tick fingerprints verify determinism.

This milestone is a **skeleton** — the current feature breakdown is the initial scaffolding. Each feature will expand significantly as game design progresses.

**Blocked By:** First Light

**Prerequisites before any code task:**

- [ ] 1-page Game Design Document (GDD) approved
- [ ] Deterministic state schema defined in Wesley

## Exit Criteria

- [ ] GDD approved
- [ ] Deterministic state schema committed
- [ ] Playable 2-player game with lockstep networking
- [ ] Desync detection functional
- [ ] Educational course material published
