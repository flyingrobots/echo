# Temporal Spec Lock

Priority: P1  
Status: Planned  
Blocked By: none

Objective: freeze foundational temporal semantics before time-travel implementation and proof+time convergence.

## Features

- [F7.1 TT0 Time Model Spec Lock](./F7.1-time-model-spec-lock.md) (Repo: Echo)

## Exit Criteria

- HistoryTime/HostTime classifications are complete and reviewed.
- Tick-only TTL/deadline semantics are normative and unambiguous.
- Time semantics are stable enough for downstream implementation work.
