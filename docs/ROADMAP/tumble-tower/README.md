# Tumble Tower

> **Priority:** P2 | **Status:** Planned | **Est:** TBD (current skeleton ~45h)

A stacking-blocks physics game demonstrating deterministic rigid-body simulation. Progressive complexity: AABB → rotation → friction → sleeping bodies.

This milestone is a **skeleton** — the current feature breakdown is the initial scaffolding. Each feature will expand significantly as game design progresses.

**Blocked By:** First Light

**Prerequisites before any code task:**

- [ ] 1-page Game Design Document (GDD) approved
- [ ] Deterministic physics state schema defined in Wesley

## Exit Criteria

- [ ] GDD approved
- [ ] Deterministic physics state schema committed
- [ ] Playable stacking game with AABB → rotation → friction → sleeping
- [ ] Lockstep harness + desync breaker tests passing
- [ ] Educational course material published
