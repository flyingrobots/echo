# F2.3: Wesley Go Public

Wesley-repo work. Prepare the Wesley repository for open-source release: README polish, contributor documentation, CI hardening, and legal review.

## T-2-3-1: README, contributor guide, and CI hardening

**User Story:** As a potential Wesley contributor, I want clear onboarding documentation and a reliable CI pipeline so that I can understand the project and submit quality PRs.

**Requirements:**

- R1: Rewrite `README.md` with project overview, architecture diagram (text-based), quick start, and API reference links.
- R2: Add `CONTRIBUTING.md` with development setup, coding conventions, PR process, and testing requirements.
- R3: CI must run lint (ESLint), type-check (tsc --noEmit), unit tests, and snapshot tests on every PR.
- R4: CI must run on Node.js LTS (latest two versions).
- R5: Add `LICENSE` file (Apache-2.0) and verify all source files have SPDX headers.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] AC1: README renders correctly on GitHub with no broken links.
- [ ] AC2: A new contributor can run `npm install && npm test` successfully following CONTRIBUTING.md.
- [ ] AC3: CI passes on both Node.js 20 and Node.js 22.
- [ ] AC4: All `.ts` files have SPDX license headers.
- [ ] AC5: `LICENSE` file is present at repo root.

**Definition of Done:**

- [ ] Code reviewed and merged
- [ ] Tests pass (CI green)
- [ ] Documentation updated (if applicable)

**Scope:** Repo: Wesley. `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `LICENSE`, CI workflow files, SPDX headers.
**Out of Scope:** API reference generation (automated docs). Marketing website. npm publish automation.

**Test Plan:**

- **Goldens:** N/A (documentation task).
- **Failures:** Verify CI fails on lint violations and type errors (intentional break test).
- **Edges:** CI matrix covers both LTS Node.js versions.
- **Fuzz/Stress:** N/A.

**Blocked By:** none
**Blocking:** none

**Est. Hours:** 6h
**Expected Complexity:** ~200 LoC (CI config ~80, docs ~120 lines of prose)
