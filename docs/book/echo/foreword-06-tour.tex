\chapter*{Foreword}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Foreword}

This booklet is a guided walk through Echo's source code. Rather than explaining
concepts in the abstract, we trace actual function calls, examine real data
structures, and follow intents from ingestion to commit.

\bigskip
\textbf{How to read this tour:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{With the code open.} Each chapter references specific files and
        line numbers. Open the crate in your editor and follow along.
  \item \textbf{In order, the first time.} The chapters mirror the runtime flow:
        ingestion $\to$ planning $\to$ execution $\to$ commit. Later, dip in
        anywhere.
  \item \textbf{Focus on the ``why.''} The code shows \emph{what} happens; the
        commentary explains \emph{why} it's designed that way.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip
The final chapter assembles a complete call graph from user action to committed
state, with complexity annotations. Use it as a reference map when you get lost
in the codebase.
