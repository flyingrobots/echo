\chapter*{Foreword}
Echo is a deterministic, multiverse-aware engine. This booklet walks you in with progressive layers: orient yourself, learn the core building blocks, then dive into math and operations. Each shelf can stand alone; together they form the full Echo field guide.

\bigskip
If you are new, start with the onboarding roadmap and glossary. If you build or extend Echo, keep the determinism contract and scheduler flow in view. Future work will deepen each part and add more diagrams as Echo evolves.
