\section{What is Echo?}

Echo is a \textbf{deterministic, multiverse-aware Entity Component System (ECS)} engine. Unlike traditional game engines that prioritize visual fidelity or editor convenience, Echo prioritizes \textbf{determinism}, \textbf{state preservation}, and \textbf{simulation integrity}.

It is built on the concepts described by the \AION{} Foundations Series papers---"Worldline Algebra for Recursive Provenance"  (WARP) graphs---meaning that the entire game state is a WARP graph, and updates are deterministic graph rewrites. This allows for features that are practically impossible in standard engines, such as:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Perfect Determinism:} Given the same initial state and inputs, the simulation will evolve identically on any machine (x86, ARM, WASM).
    \item \textbf{Time Travel:} The ability to rollback the simulation to any previous tick, branch time into alternative realities, and merge them back.
    \item \textbf{Renderer Agnosticism:} Echo does not care how it is drawn. It emits an event stream that describes the latest graph writes applied to the \WARP{} State at a given tick.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Core Philosophy}

Echo was born from earlier prototypes and operates under a set of strict cultural principles:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Tests Are The Spec:} Documentation as performance art.
    \item \textbf{Hexagonal Domain Boundary:} Pattern of patterns.
    \item \textbf{We Do Not Rewrite History:} Reminder: The immutable ledger makes git blame eternal.
    \item \textbf{Predictable Loop:} Every frame has a cryptographic description.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Who is Echo For?}

Echo is designed for general use. It uses WARP graphs, which give it:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{RTS Games:} Where thousands of units must remain in sync across a network.
    \item \textbf{Fighting Games:} Where rollback netcode (GGPO-style) is a requirement, not a feature.
    \item \textbf{Scientific Simulations:} Where reproducibility is critical.
    \item \textbf{Collaborative Tools:} Where multiple users edit a shared state (using the branching/merging capabilities).
\end{itemize}
