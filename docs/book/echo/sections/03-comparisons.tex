\section{Echo vs. The World}

Echo differs significantly from general-purpose engines like Unity, Unreal, or Godot. While those engines optimize for "getting something on screen fast" and providing a rich editor, Echo optimizes for **correctness under complex temporal manipulation**.

\subsection{Key Differentiators}

\subsubsection{1. Determinism as a Constraint}
In Unity or Unreal, `float` math depends on the CPU architecture. A simulation running on an Intel chip might diverge from one on an ARM chip after a few thousand frames.
Echo uses \texttt{F32Scalar} (canonicalized floats) or fixed-point math to ensure bit-perfect identity across all platforms. This enables:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Replay Systems:} Store only inputs, replay the game exactly.
    \item \textbf{Anti-Cheat:} Verify game logic on the server with zero tolerance for deviation.
    \item \textbf{Desync Debugging:} If a bug happens, it happens exactly the same way every time.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{2. The Multiverse (Branching)}
Traditional engines have one "World". To do a "prediction" (e.g., for netcode), they must serialize the whole world, step forward, and then deserialize it back (a slow process).
Echo uses **Copy-on-Write (COW)** archetype storage. It can fork the world instantly.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Main Timeline:} The "real" game.
    \item \textbf{Speculative Branch:} Used by AI to "think ahead" or by netcode to predict movement.
\end{itemize}
These branches share memory for unchanged data, making branching extremely cheap.

\subsubsection{3. Rulial Multi-Graph vs. Object Update}
In typical engines, objects have an `Update()` function. Order of execution is often ill-defined or rigid.
Echo uses a graph rewriting approach. Systems define rules. The Scheduler identifies independent subgraphs that can be updated in parallel (using MWMR - Multi-Writer Multi-Reader patterns) without race conditions, because the data dependency is explicit.
