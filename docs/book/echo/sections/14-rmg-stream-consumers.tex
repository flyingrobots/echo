\section{Consuming RMG Streams: Snapshots and Diffs}
\label{sec:rmg-stream-consumers}

With the wire framing in place (Section~\ref{sec:js-abi-wire}), Echo apps
still need a clear contract for how to \emph{interpret} RMG-related messages.
This section specifies how engines, the session host, and client apps exchange
RMG snapshots and diffs, and what each participant must do to stay in
lockstep.

At a protocol level, this is the same contract used by the Echo Session
Service and the RMG Viewer:
Section~\ref{sec:session-service} explains how the host enforces gapless
streams and fans out frames, while Section~\ref{sec:rmg-viewer} shows one
concrete tool (the RMG Viewer) that consumes these streams and projects them
into a 3D ring of RMGs.

\subsection{Roles and Responsibilities}

\begin{description}
  \item[Engine] Owns the authoritative RMG state and emits structural
    changes per epoch.
  \item[Session Host] Acts as a hub and history keeper:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Tracks one stream per \texttt{RmgId} (worldline).
      \item Enforces gapless epoch sequences per \texttt{RmgId}.
      \item Fans out RMG frames to subscribed clients.
    \end{itemize}
  \item[Client App] Any tool or runtime that wants to observe or publish an
    RMG: game, viewer, inspector, profiler, \dots
\end{description}

\subsection{Role Summary}

Table~\ref{tab:rmg-role-summary} summarizes the responsibilities of each role
in the RMG streaming pipeline.

\begin{table}[h]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{@{}p{0.18\textwidth}p{0.74\textwidth}@{}}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Role} & \textbf{Responsibilities} \\
    \midrule
    Engine
      & Owns the authoritative RMG; emits epoch-aligned snapshots and diffs.
        Computes canonical state hashes after each commit.
        Guarantees that each \texttt{Diff} maps from epoch \(k\) to \(k+1\). \\
    Session Host
      & Tracks per-\texttt{RmgId} streams (\texttt{last\_epoch},
        \texttt{last\_hash}, latest snapshot, subscribers, producer).
        Enforces gapless diffs (\texttt{from = last\_epoch},
        \texttt{to = from + 1}). Fans out accepted frames to all
        subscribers for that \texttt{RmgId}. \\
    Client App
      & Maintains local per-\texttt{RmgId} state (epoch, graph, history).
        Applies the snapshot/diff algorithm in this section.
        Treats any gap or hash mismatch as a desync and drops the stream.
        Projects the resulting RMGs into its own UI/logic (e.g.\ a 3D ring,
        inspector view, debug overlay). \\

\end{table}

\subsection{RMG Frames}

At the JS-ABI level, RMG traffic is carried as:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{op = "rmg\_stream"} payloads containing
        \(\langle\texttt{rmg\_id}, \texttt{frame}\rangle\).
  \item \texttt{frame} is either:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Snapshot}:
        \(\{\texttt{epoch}, \texttt{graph: RenderGraph}, \texttt{state\_hash?}\}\).
      \item \textbf{Diff}:
        \(\{\texttt{from\_epoch}, \texttt{to\_epoch}, \texttt{ops: Vec<RmgOp>}, \texttt{state\_hash?}\}\).
    \end{itemize}
  \item \texttt{RmgOp} is a structural graph mutation:
    Add/Update/Remove node or edge with a data patch.
\end{itemize}

Each \texttt{RmgId} corresponds to a single logical stream with at most one
producer and many consumers.

\subsection{Consumer State Machine}

Applications that consume RMG streams follow a small state machine per
\texttt{RmgId}. Figure~\ref{fig:rmg-consumer-sm} shows the idealized flow.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Per-RMG Consumer Algorithm}

For each subscribed \texttt{RmgId}, a client app maintains:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The most recent epoch number \(e\) (or \emph{None} before a snapshot).
  \item A local \texttt{RenderGraph} mirror of the stream.
  \item Optional cached \texttt{state\_hash}.
\end{itemize}

On frames for that \texttt{RmgId}:

\paragraph{Snapshot frame}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Replace the local \texttt{RenderGraph} with the snapshot graph.
  \item Set \(e = \texttt{snapshot.epoch}\).
  \item If a \texttt{state\_hash} is present, recompute a canonical hash of the
        local graph and compare. Mismatch $\Rightarrow$ enter ``Error'' state.
  \item Rebuild any renderable scene or indices needed by the app.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Diff frame}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item If \(e\) is \emph{None}, treat this as a protocol error: clients must
        see a snapshot first.
  \item Enforce gapless epochs:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Require \(\texttt{diff.from\_epoch} = e\).
      \item Require \(\texttt{diff.to\_epoch} = e + 1\).
    \end{itemize}
    Any violation $\Rightarrow$ enter ``Error'' state and drop the stream.
  \item Apply each \texttt{RmgOp} in order to the local \texttt{RenderGraph}.
  \item Set \(e = \texttt{diff.to\_epoch}\).
  \item If \texttt{state\_hash} is present, recompute and compare. Mismatch
        $\Rightarrow$ enter ``Error'' state.
  \item Rebuild or incrementally update the app’s renderable scene.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Engine and Session Host Responsibilities}

The engine and session host together ensure that clients can safely apply the
algorithm above:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Engine}:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Emits structural diffs (\texttt{RmgOp}) that map exactly from
            epoch \(k\) to \(k+1\).
      \item Computes a canonical \texttt{state\_hash} after each commit.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Session Host}:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Tracks \(\texttt{last\_epoch}\) and \(\texttt{last\_hash}\) per
            \texttt{RmgId}.
      \item On producer input:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Accepts a \textbf{Snapshot} as a reset for that stream.
          \item Accepts a \textbf{Diff} only if:
            \(\texttt{from\_epoch} = \texttt{last\_epoch}\) and
            \(\texttt{to\_epoch} = \texttt{from\_epoch} + 1\).
        \end{itemize}
      \item Fan-outs each accepted frame to all subscribers of that
            \texttt{RmgId}.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Clients can therefore assume:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Each subscribed stream is gapless and totally ordered.
  \item Each RMG frame is self-identified by its \texttt{RmgId}.
  \item A fresh snapshot always provides a safe starting point after
        disconnect or error.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Multi-RMG Applications}

An application may subscribe to multiple \texttt{RmgId}s at once. The
recommended pattern is:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Maintain a map \(\texttt{RmgId} \mapsto \texttt{RmgRenderState}\).
  \item For each incoming frame, route it to the appropriate entry and run the
        per-RMG consumer algorithm.
  \item Keep a separate ``view model'' (e.g., the RMG ring used by the viewer)
        that decides how to arrange and highlight the various RMGs in the UI.
\end{itemize}

This keeps the network-facing logic uniform across apps: everyone reuses the
same snapshot/diff semantics, while higher-level tools can choose their own
visualization and interaction patterns.

\paragraph{Aside: RMG Viewer as a Consumer}

The Echo RMG Viewer (Section~\ref{sec:rmg-viewer}) is a direct application of
this pattern:
\begin{itemize}
  \item It maintains per-\texttt{RmgId} render state (graph, epoch, history).
  \item It routes frames from the session service into the per-RMG algorithm
        above, treating any epoch gap or hash mismatch as a fatal desync.
  \item Its UI layer simply arranges those RMGs on a ring and lets the user
        pick which one is in focus, without changing the underlying network
        contract.
\end{itemize}
