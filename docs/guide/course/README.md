# Course Notes (Authoring)

This folder contains the Demo 2 course pages.

Authoring conventions:

- Prefer short pages with a clear outcome and a verify step.
- Introduce jargon only after the reader has used the idea.
- Every module should include at least one of:
  - a “verify” step (fingerprint/replay check)
  - a “failure demo” (controlled desync)
- Rendering must be described as derived output (never authoritative).
