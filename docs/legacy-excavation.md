# Legacy Excavation Log (Placeholder)

This document is a place to record “legacy prototype” artifacts we discover (old folders, old
designs, abandoned experiments) and the decisions we make about them:

- keep concept (rewrite cleanly)
- redesign (needs rethinking)
- discard (no longer relevant)

If you add entries here, prefer linking to concrete files and capture a short “why” in the decision
log when a choice affects public surface area or determinism.

## Template

| Artifact | What It Was | What We Keep | Action | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `path/to/thing` | (1–2 lines) | (concepts) | keep/redesign/discard | (gotchas, deps, links) |
