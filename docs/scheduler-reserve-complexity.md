# Scheduler `reserve()` Time Complexity Analysis

This document has been **merged** into the canonical warp-core scheduler doc:

- [docs/scheduler-warp-core.md](./scheduler-warp-core.md)

It remains as a stable link target for older references.

The full analysis now lives in [docs/scheduler-warp-core.md](./scheduler-warp-core.md).
