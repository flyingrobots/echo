# Scheduler (Doc Map)

This page is a hub for scheduler-related docs. If you’re trying to understand how Echo schedules
work (or why some scheduler invariants exist), start with the spec and then drop into benchmarks
and notes as needed.

## Start With the Spec

- Scheduler spec (normative intent): [/spec-scheduler](/spec-scheduler)

## Performance + Validation

- Scheduler benchmarks (scenarios + targets): [/scheduler-benchmarks](/scheduler-benchmarks)
- Reserve complexity notes: [/scheduler-reserve-complexity](/scheduler-reserve-complexity)
- Reserve validation plan: [/scheduler-reserve-validation](/scheduler-reserve-validation)
- Reserve benchmark writeup: [/benchmarks/RESERVE_BENCHMARK](/benchmarks/RESERVE_BENCHMARK)

## Explorations (May Be Out of Date)

- Radix optimization notes: [/notes/scheduler-radix-optimization](/notes/scheduler-radix-optimization)
- Radix optimization follow-up: [/notes/scheduler-radix-optimization-2](/notes/scheduler-radix-optimization-2)
