# WARP View Protocol Tasks [MOVED]

This checklist moved into the WVP spec so the tasks live alongside the protocol definition and status notes; the target includes the complete v0 implementation checklist.

Retention policy: this stub will remain as a redirect until the next docs audit pass, then be removed once inbound links are cleaned up.
